# Task.py: contains implementation of the Task class
# Authors: Mike Hering, Ben Shoeman

# Task objects change the state of Devices on an automatic basis. They run at a
# given time of the day for a given Device, and do the specified actions (which
# is a dictionary, to match the state dictionary of Devices). Tasks utilize the
# Time object to know if that time has passed or not, so they know to run.
