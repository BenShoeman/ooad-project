# Room.py: contains implementation of the Room class
# Authors: Mike Hering, Ben Shoeman

# The Rooms utilize the Facade pattern. A Room provides a simple means for Users
# to interact with Devices and add Tasks without having to know about those
# details. A Room contains several Devices and keeps track of/changes their
# states, and it also creates Tasks that the TaskRunner can run on those Devices.
